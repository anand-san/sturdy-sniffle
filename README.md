`npm run bootstrap` should be enough to get the application running considering you have `nodeJS` installed.

On running the `bootstrap script` the program will run with a sample data present in the root of this repository `./sample.csv` . You can ofcourse add/remove data from there.

If you want to use your own file prefer running the start script `npm run start <filename.csv>`. You need to pass the full filename with its extension. Please note that the program will onyl accept csv files.
